Add the locations read surface: `agendas.locations.list` (cursor-paginated, `detailed` toggle, `search`/`uid`/`extId`/`bbox`/`createdAt`/`updatedAt` filters) and `agendas.locations.get` (full record; a merged location answers 404 with code `merged` and the surviving uid in `error.details.mergedIn`).

New schemas `LocationSummary`, `Location`, `LocationList`, `LocationExtId` and `LocationAdditionalFields` (the legacy tag set exposed under the events-aligned `additionalFields` name). BREAKING for pre-1.0 consumers of the generated types: the event-embedded location snapshot schema is renamed `Location` → `EventLocation` to free the canonical name for the resource.
