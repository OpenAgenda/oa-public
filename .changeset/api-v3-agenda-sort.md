`GET /agendas` now ranks `?search` results by relevance and accepts a `?sort` parameter. Previously the list forced `createdAt.desc` unconditionally, which buried text-search matches under the most recently created agendas. The default is now conditional — relevance (`_score`) when `search` is set, the stable `createdAt.desc` otherwise — and an explicit `sort` (`createdAt.desc` | `recentlyAddedEvents.desc`) overrides it. The chosen sort is pinned into the `after` cursor (validated against the allowlist, so a forged cursor cannot smuggle an out-of-contract sort), keeping a page sequence consistent.
