Every place that mentions agenda additional fields now points at the event form schema endpoint that declares them: the `additionalFields`/`additionalFieldMetrics` facet families and their `…Keys` params gain the breadcrumb (`GET /agendas/{agendaUid}/events/schema`), and the `additionalFields` filter param and `AdditionalFields` component had it but pointed at a stale pre-v3 path (`/settings/eventSchema`) — fixed.
